# final_graphics

# Work 12: The End

## Proposal

### Sunan Tajwar, Period 10

### Features

## Implemented MDL Features:
- Implement the `mesh` command (compatible with .obj files)
- Save_Coordinate_System
- Added Cylinders
- Added Cones

## MDL Features I tried to implement but ultimately failed:
- Implement Gouraud and Phong shading using `shading` command

## Testing Files:
-final.mdl (Gallery Image)
-mesh_testing.mdl (Mesh with .obj files)
-shape_test.mdl (Cylinders and Cones)
-saveco_test.mdl (Save Coordinate System)

For the final project, you are to add any features youâ€™d like to your current graphics engine. Below are some good places to start (you may work on other features if you prefer, just talk to me about it first

- **Existing, MDL Commands/Features:**
  - light
    - Add a light to the symbol table
    - When calculating diffuse and specular: loop through all the lights.
  - mesh
    - Use an external .obj file for polygons
    - Read up on the obj format [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file).
    - Find example files [here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html).
    - Make sure you deal with .obj files that list quadrilateral faces instead of triangles in some way.
  - set
    - Assign a value to a knob
  - saveknobs
    - Save current knob values to a list
  - tween
    - Produce an animation by going between two knob lists
  - shading
    - Use different shading techniques / calculating I more or less frequently.
    - A hash table structure can be very helpful for dealing with vertex normals. If you are woking in c, check out [uthash](https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/).
  - save_coordinate_system
    - Save a copy of the top of the stack to the symbol table
    - use this coordinate system when drawing shapes (extra argument required)
- **Additions to MDL that require changes to the language:**
  - New primitive shapes
  - Change the behavior of vary
    - add a parameter to change how it calculates the change over time. e.g. Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Arbitrary equation, etc.
  - Anti-aliasing / Super-sampling
    - Reduce pixelated edges by calculating a higher resolution version of the image then reducing it to the intended size
  - Texture mapping
  - Using vary to move lights.
